merge:

The merge() method is a crucial JPA operation that reconciles the state of a detached entity 
with the current persistence context. 

It's primarily used when you want to update an existing entity that is no longer managed by the EntityManager.


 Detached Entity Handling

When an entity is in a detached state (previously managed but no longer associated with 
an active persistence context), merge() creates a new managed instance.

If the entity doesn't exist in the database, it will be persisted as a new record.



Merge vs Persist

persist(): Creates a new entity if it doesn't exist
merge(): Updates an existing entity or creates a new one if not found



Merge vs Update

In Hibernate, update() throws an exception if the entity is already managed
merge() works seamlessly with both managed and detached entities
