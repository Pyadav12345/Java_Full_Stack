Caused by: org.hibernate.TransientPropertyValueException: object references an unsaved transient instance - save the transient instance before flushing

This error occurs in Hibernate ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) when you try to persist an entity that has a reference to another entity that hasn't been saved to the database yet.



Let me explain with an example:

Imagine you have two entity classes representing your database tables:

java
@Entity
public class Employee {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    private Long employeeId;
    private String employeeName;
    
    @ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "assetId_fk")
    private Asset asset;
    
    // getters and setters
}

@Entity
public class Asset {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    private Long assetId;
    private String assetName;
    
    // getters and setters
}


When Hibernate tries to save the Employee entity, it sees that it references an Asset object that is still in a transient state 
(not saved to the database). This causes the TransientPropertyValueException.

To fix this issue, you need to save the referenced entity first:

Alternatively, you could use cascade operations to automatically save associated entities:

java
@Entity
public class Employee {
    // ...
    
    @ManyToOne(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
    @JoinColumn(name = "assetId_fk")
    private Asset asset;
    
    // ...
}
With the cascade setting, when you save the Employee, Hibernate will automatically save the Asset as well.
